# üóìÔ∏è Python Web App for Event Scheduling

This is a simple Python web application built with Flask web framework that allows user to view upcoming events and their schedules. 
It uses a SQLite database for data persistence, provides REST API endpoints with Swagger documentation, and includes unit tests with Pytest.

## üëÄ Demo

The home page contains the list of all upcoming events.

![home page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485c9ca8-9b8d-49d8-8c86-d64de02c59d9)

By clicking on the particular row in the table user navigates to the schedule page, where the details of the event can be seen.

Swagger UI provides a clear API documentation and serves for interaction with endpoints.
